i theorize that its a "blowfish" crypt, either "VABB7yO9xm7xWXROeASsmsgnY0o0sDMJev7zFHhwQS8mvM8V5xQQp" is a hash key
and "Lc6cDCFXDWTiFzZ2H9skYkiJ/DpQtnM/uZ0" is a string to be decrypted or its the other way around

after further reading it seems that to be able to decrypt this i will require a bruteforce aproach, lets find some tools

hashcat is what ive found, not sure how to use it but lets bruteforce that too lmao
