Good optimization strategy: Save the moves in a linked list and then optimize them when possible after parsing it.

these can be optimized:
sa + sb = ss; ra + rb = rr; rra + rrb = rrr

these can dissapear:
pa + pb; sa + sa; ra + rra

Maybe checking if some chunk is already reverse sorted all the time is also a good idea


An important part of the project is that time optimization is completely useless, checking things is free so its always worth it.
